sim3DInc.cpp helps to rewrite "SimRobot for Unix" controllers
for "SimRobot for Win32 / OS/2". All you have to do is

- under Windows, you must compile for Win32 (see README).
- rename all your *.cc files to *.cpp
- add Examples\sim3DInc.cpp and your *.cpp files to the project. 
  Disable "destructor cleanup" for sim3DInc.cpp and all your files.
  Otherwise the controller will crash.
- instead of including sim3DInc.hh in your files, include 
  Examples\sim3DInc.h.
- change your main function's type to
    int Main(int argc,char* argv[]); // capital M!
- remove any signal handling.
- remove all console I/O (you may use files instead).
- rename your scene's WORLD object:
    WORLD "sim3DInc" // case is important!

Limitations:
- You can link only one sim3DInc-controller to SimRobot.
- If you reset the simulation before your controller has ended, the
  memory the controller has allocated is not freed until you leave SimRobot.
- Unlike other controllers, sim3DInc starts your controller during the
  first simulation step and not immediatly after the scene has been
  copiled.
